        <div><h3> Manual HDX </h3>
            Manual HDX is designed to strike a balance between the efficiency of Auto HDX and
            the precision of manual HD Exchange viewing. It works by extracting peaks in the 
            same way as Auto HDX, but it skips the peak detection step, leaving the peak 
            detection up to the user. This feature is useful to enable a high level of control
            and precision, while still eliminating the time-consuming step of manually loading and
            selecting EIC peaks.</div>
