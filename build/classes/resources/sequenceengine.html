        Sequence engine is a new feature designed to enable quick peptide 
        recognition and analysis. Select the sequence engine option from the 
        Advanced menu to begin. <br><br> The sequence engine requires you 
        to input the protein sequence you wish to analyze, as well as the 
        type of digest preferred. Currently, simulated pepsin and trypsin digests 
        can be performed, as well as the option to analyze an undigested 
        sequence. Once you have entered your sequence, choose the data file 
        you wish to analyze, and enter a title for the output document. The 
        output will be generated as a text file in the Documents folder. <br><br>
        You have the option to enter several different parameters in order to 
        speed up analysis. You can select a limited time window if you only 
        wish to analyze this range - this will speed up analysis considerably. 
        Leave this space blank to analyze the entire run. You can also enter in 
        possible missed cleavage sites if you are simulating a digestion - this 
        will increase the analysis time but help identify more fragments in the 
        event of incomplete digestion. Last, you can set the threshold for peak 
        detection (default setting - 5000). Lowering this number will require longer 
        analysis, but will detect more peptides in your sample.
