            <h3> Check peptide accuracy </h3>
            MS Reader has a feature to check the accuracy of peptides within your 
            sample. Every Auto HDX run will automatically compare the isotopic 
            distribution of your peak to the theoretical isotopic envelope and 
            derive an accuracy percentage, displayed on the HDX form. You can also 
            check the accuracy of a peptide before running Auto HDX. From the file 
            menu, select "Check peptide accuracy", with your non-deuterated sample 
            loaded. MS Reader will extract your peptide and score it against the 
            theoretical distribution. Typically, scores above 75% can be considered 
            good matches. However, sequencing cannot be done by a single MS instrument - 
            you must first compare tandem MS data to get accurate sequences. MS Reader 
            only helps to verify you are seeing the same peptide each time.
