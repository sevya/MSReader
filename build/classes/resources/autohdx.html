        <div><h3> Auto HDX </h3>
            Auto HDX is the fastest, most efficient way to process data. It is designed
            for identification of well-defined peaks, in order to enable high-throughput
            data analysis. You first select a folder containing all of the time points
            for a given run. Next, you will select the peptide of interest from the
            currently loaded peptide list. Once you have set all these parameters,
            Auto HDX will go to work extracting your desired peptide. It works by picking
            out the most abundant peak on the EIC trace within a certain range of
            the given elution time, for the given m/z ratio. Once it has peaks for each time
            point, a peak detection algorithm will accurately define the boundaries
            for each peak, calculate the centroid mass for each peak, and will display an 
            HDX form showing the mass shift over time. If a peak is not detected, or if the 
            signal to noise ratio is too low, the peak window will leave the peak untrimmed 
            and will display the reason for failure to detect a peak. Once the user views
            the data and can determine whether it should be considered a peak, he/she
            can choose to eliminate this time point (in the case there is no distinct peak), 
            or to override the detection algorithm and trim anyway.
            <br><br>
            Auto HDX also has the option to include spectral processing steps to facilitate
            peak identification/detection. If you are having trouble getting an accurate
            peak detection, try enabling "Smooth spectrum in auto HDX" under the Options menu.
            This makes the detection process quicker and more accurate. </div>
