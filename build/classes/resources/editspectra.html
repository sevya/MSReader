            <h3> Edit Spectra </h3>
            The Edit menu has a variety of options to process your raw spectra.
            To smooth the currently loaded spectrum (the spectrum that is displayed
            in the right panel), select Smooth Spectrum from the Edit menu. MS Reader
            defaults to a Savitzky-Golay smoothing algorithm, with a filter size of 5 and
            a polynomial degree of 4.
            <br> <br>
            The type of smoothing applied and the filter size can both be edited from the 
            Smoothing Options menu. You can also subtract background from your samples by
            selecting the Background Subtraction option. This option requires you to input
            a control scan to calculate the background. 
            
            Under the Options menu, you can choose whether to apply smoothing or background
            subtraction to spectra while in Auto HDX mode.
