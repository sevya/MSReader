            <h3> HDX Form </h3>
            After focusing on the peptide peaks for each time point, MS Reader generates
            a form combining all of the time points into a single chart to visualize the 
            change in molecular weight of a peptide over time; this is referred to as
            a HDX form. This can be used to analyze the kinetics and deuterium intake of 
            each peptide. When you view an HD exchange run, MS Reader shows the desired
            peak from each one of the time points, along with displayed the time exchange 
            chart. MS Reader calculates the deuterium intake in terms of change in molecular 
            weight, divided by the number of residues in a peptide. This enables the user to 
            compare deuterium exchange rates between long and short peptides. The combined 
            peptide shift form can be saved with the .hdx extension.

            <h3> Fitting Equation to Data </h3>
            The exchange window has a feature to add a regression line to the data.
            This feature fits the equation y = A(1 - e<sup>-kt</sup>) to the user 
            supplied data. In this equation, A represents the upper limit of deuterium intake,
            while K represents the rate constant.

            <h3> Saving and Opening Time Exchange Runs </h3>
            MS Reader allows you to save exchange data so that you can compare the
            rate of deuterium intake for the same peptide over multiple runs. Time exchange
            data is stored with the .hdx extension and can later be opened by MS Reader, 
            either by comparing runs side by side or overlaying them onto the same chart.

            <h3> Exporting .hdx files to Excel </h3>
            MS Reader also allows you to convert time exchange data to a format that 
            can be read by Excel. Select Export .hdx to Excel under the HD Exchange menu
            to select a .hdx file that you would like to convert. If more than one
            .hdx file is selected the data will be merged into a single
            Excel document.
