            <h3> Generate Heat Map </h3>
            Generating a heat map is a feature that allows you to take your hydrogen 
            exchange data and view it in the context of a molecular structure. MS Reader
            works with the molecular visualization software PyMol (DeLano Scientific, Inc.)
            to overlay exchange rates onto structures. You must have PyMol installed on your
            computer to use this feature. PyMol is freely available via its website, www.pymol.org.
            
            <br><br>To generate a heat map, you have to enter in several parameters. 
            You can either create an exchange- or protection-based map, to either 
            show the exchange of various peptides, or the difference in exchange 
            of peptides between two states (i.e. free and bound). You can also choose 
            your preferred data source: either MSReader-generated HDX files, or 
            Excel files. If you choose HDX files, you have to make sure to generate 
            a regression line before saving the file, or else it will not be valid. 
            If you choose Excel files, you must enter data in the correct format: 
            Column A must contain the peptide sequences, and Column B must contain 
            the exchange value in D/res. The numeric values must be entered as numbers, 
            not formulas, or else a heat map cannot be generated.<br><br>Next, 
            choose a PDB file and enter your protein sequence. PDBs can be loaded 
            either from the user's computer, or downloaded from the RCSB database. 
            <br><br> MSReader uses a default color gradient scale, but you can freely edit 
            and save your own on the "Color gradient" tab. Blue gradient is used for 
            analyzing exchange, and the red gradient is used for protection maps.
