            <h3> Loading a file </h3>
            To load a file, click on the "Load file" option under the File menu.
            Then, choose your file from a location on your computer. After loading,
            the left panel will show the total ion chromatogram (TIC) from your data,
            and the right panel will show the selected mass spectrum. Click on the
            total ion chromatogram to view the mass spectrum at that time point.

            <h3> Chromatogram Types </h3>
            The chromatogram generated from your data will appear in the left panel. 
            Total ion chromatogram (TIC) is the default option. The TIC represents the total 
            ion intensity for each scan over the course of the run. You can change the 
            appearance of the left panel by clicking on Chromatogram Options
            under the file menu. Base peak chromatogram (BPC) shows only the most intense ion peak 
            for each time point, and extracted ion chromatogram (EIC) allows you to view the intensity
            of any ion over the course of the run. Choosing the EIC options requires at least one m/z
            input value, but also allows you to define a range of m/z to extract.
