        <h3> Getting Started </h3>
        <div>
            To start using MS Reader, you first need to load a raw data file. Currently, 
            MS reader only accepts data in the netCDF (.CDF) format. Once you have a data 
            file loaded, you can start viewing spectra at different time points throughout
            the run, starting hydrogen exchange runs, and viewing mass shifts over time. 
            NetCDF (sometimes known as .AIA) converters are available for every
            manufacturer.

        <h3> About MSReader </h3>
        <div>   
            MSReader was designed to make hydrogen exchange data easier to analyze,
            organize, and illustrate. It features a variety of ways to analyze data,
            enabling the user to either process data quickly with little oversight,
            or extract peaks with great precision in a timely manner. The variety of 
            different ways to analyze data is what makes MS Reader an invaluable part of
            any hydrogen exchange experiment.

        <h3> About NetCDF </h3>
        <div>
            NetCDF is an open source format for sharing scientific data. Converters are
            available for most instruments. To get CDF files from your data acquisition package:<br><br>

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Micromass MassLynx: Start > Programs > MassLynx > DataBridge.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finnigan Xcalibur: "Roadmap View" > Tools > File Converter.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finnigan ICIS2: ICIS Executive > File > Convert > "DAT to ANDI-MS".<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agilent ChemStation: File > "Export MS Data to AIA"; there is also a batch mode from the same menu.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sciex Analyst: Reportedly there is a macro available upon request from Sciex.
        </div>
        <h3> Navigating the interface </h3>
        <div>
            The File menu features options to load a file, choose the chromatogram type
            you wish to view, and show the list of user-generated peptides. The Edit 
            menu allows you to edit the mass spectra with signal
            smoothing and background subtraction options. The HD Exchange menu is where you
            can initialize a HD exchange run to manually view mass shifts over time.
            To view mass shifts generated automatically, select Auto HDX or Manual HDX under
            Experimental heading.
