            <h3> HD Exchange Example </h3>
            To start off my HD exchange run, I'll first load a file into MS Reader.
            The Load File option can be found under the File menu, or by pressing Ctrl-O.
            <br><div> <img src="load_file.png" alt="load file" width="500" height="400"> </div><br>
            Once I have my file loaded, I'll see my ion intensity over time on the left,
            and an individual mass spectrum at a given time point on the right. Click on 
            the left panel at any time point to view the mass spectrum at that time point.
            Alternatively, enter the time point in the Get Spectrum At Time box underneath
            the left panel. Since my peptide of interest elutes around ~8.44 minutes, I'll 
            choose that time point.
            <br><div> <img src="loaded_file.png" alt="loaded file" width="500" height="400"></div><br>
            At this point, if I see a peak at my desired m/z, I know that the peptide is
            present at this elution time, and I can load it into my HD exchange run. I click
            "Create HD Exchange", and then "Add File" to load this spectrum into my HDX run.

            Next, I'll want to load a spectrum at roughly the same elution time from a different
            deuteration time point. It's important to load a non deuterated sample (H20) to be able
            to view change in molecular weight. Once I have all the time points loaded into my HD
            exchange run, I select "View HD Exchange" under the HD exchange menu. MS Reader then
            allows me to select my peptide of interest, or input a m/z value manually.
            <br><div> <img src="choose_peptide.png" alt="choose peptide" width="500" height="400"></div><br>
            I'll select the peptide F.QKTMKVTGVTTQGVKSLL.T with the m/z ratio 960.0, that elutes at roughly 8.44 minutes.
            Next, MS Reader will bring up the peak representing this peptide at each time point,
            and bring up an HDX form showing the mass shift over time, represented by deuterium
            intake divided by number of residues. If the mass window is too broad for each time point,
            I can manually go into each time point and trim the window to focus in on my peptide. I then
            need to click "Update" on the HDX form to update it representing the new centroid values.
            I then have the option to save this graph as a .hdx file or add a regression line. Once it is
            saved as a .hdx file, I can load it into MS Reader along with other HDX forms to compare the 
            deuterium intake behavior of a certain peptide between various experiments.
