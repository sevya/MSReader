            <h3> HD Exchange </h3>
            The HD Exchange feature allows you manually load peptide peaks from 
            various time points to view
            the change in molecular weight of peptides over time. First, you need to create
            an HD exchange run. This will allow you to load the currently displayed spectrum
            into an HD exchange. Next, load another spectrum from a different file (i.e. the 
            next deuteration time point) to be able to view these two spectra side by side.
            An HD exchange run requires a minimum of two time points, but can load as many as
            are available. Once all the time points are loaded, select View HD Exchange to view
            these spectra side by side. The program will require you to select a peptide, or enter
            the m/z value of the peptide you are interested in viewing. It will then generate a close-up
            of the peak representing your desired peptide for each time point, as well as a table
            showing the data points. The program will also generate a chart showing the centroid 
            mass of the peptide

            <h3> Peak Detection </h3>
            One of the major difficulties with using deuterium exchange analysis software is the 
            difficulty detecting peaks representing peptides of interest. Frequently, peak detection
            algorithms will confuse peptides with noise, and will not give you the peak you are looking
            for. To avoid this problem, MS Reader includes a few different peak detection options to ensure that the peak being
            analyzed is always the one desired by the user. Each peak window has a "Trim" button, which
            uses a peak detection algorithm to eliminate trailing signal and focus in on the desired peak.
            However, for a particularly difficult peak, the user has the option to manually trim out surrounding
            noise. This way, users can quickly analyze well-separated peptides, while also precisely eliminating
            pervasive noise.
